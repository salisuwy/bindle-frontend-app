          "description": "This Foundation Workbook is designed to support the development of key literacy and numeracy skills of students in the 1-3 grade range, as well as building confidence in answering open response questions. The amount of scaffolded support decreases throughout the workbook to encourage independent learning. - Summarises all the Foundation content to be learned for each topic - Provides plenty of practice questions - Builds confidence by showing how to answer questions or work through calculations - Helps students to improve their answers by focusing on use of key scientific vocabulary, how to link key concepts, and work with graphs Each topic opens with a bulleted summary of the key ideas, reminding students of the key scientific vocabulary and equations they should be able to recall. The questions begin with confidence-building, low demand questions (multiple choice, matching, sentence completion or closed short answer) leading to more open questions including calculations as part of structured questions. The questions include applying and analysing as well as recall, for example bringing in skills used in analysing results from practical work. Frequent support notes provide hints and tips on key vocabulary, how to answer open response questions (for example by writing causal explanations), strategies for decoding questions (for example by identifying key words in the question) and how to interpret information from tables and graphs. 'Show me' writing frames demonstrate how to build longer answers, how to work with equations in science and how to convert units. In later pages the level of scaffolding is gradually reduced by removing the guided support so that students are supported in becoming independent learners throughout their GCSE course.",

The grouping of content follows that in the specification. Topic openers set the scene by providing a short overview of the links between the different chapters in a Topic. Linking questions between spreads and from chapter to chapter also help explain the narrative thread that links a Synergy topic together. Working Scientifically objectives linked to the AQA Combined Science: Synergy specification are identified, and questions addressing Working Scientifically skills embedded throughout. * Each spread is divided into three sections - starting with language, ideas and questions that are accessible to all and increasing in complexity to develop and practise ideas further. * Key concept spreads highlight core ideas that students must grasp before they can move on, and which will develop their understanding of the whole topic. * A dedicated spread for every required practical helps students analyse the practical, reflect on the science skills and knowledge they have developed and apply these skills to different contexts. * Maths skills spreads focus on the maths requirements of the AQA Combined Science specification, explaining concepts and providing opportunities to practise and apply maths in a relevant scientific context. * Throughout the book the questions become increasingly synoptic, helping students to draw together ideas from any part of Unit 1 in preparation for the terminal exams. * Higher-only content is clearly flagged so students can move seamlessly between tiers depending on their performance during the course. * End of chapter questions allow students to check that they have understood the ideas in the chapter and can apply these to new contexts. The questions are levelled in four sections of",

Each spread starts with language and ideas at a lower level and increases in complexity, engaging students of all ability levels Key concept spreads highlight knowledge that students must grasp before they can move on Dedicated pages on analysing, interpreting and evaluating practicals, so students are fully prepared for the indirect assessment. Maths activities at the appropriate level are embedded throughout, along with Maths skills pages that focus on developing the skills needed for each topic Prepare students for the demands of the new specification with differentiated questions, worked examples and lots of opportunities to practice Co-teach both Foundation and Higher tier with a single book (the Higher-only content is clearly flagged).",

Based on his experience of teaching the specification for two years, renowned author Dale Banham uses the latest thinking on memory and visible learning to raise attainment for students of all abilities. - Engage students with accessible routes into challenging topics: the text is broken down into bullet points and boxes, while stories about interesting people start each chapter, providing a memorable 'hook' for revision - Encourage students to take responsibility for their learning: tasks are structured around five 'steps to success', teaching students how to Research, Summarise, Connect, Apply and Review the content - Make learning stick: techniques such as interleaving, retrieval practice, dual coding and spaced practice help students to remember everything and use their knowledge effectively in the exams - Build top-grade skills: the higher-order thinking skills required to construct complex arguments and reach the upper levels of the AQA mark schemes are carefully modelled, with step-by-step advice - Improve exam results: practice questions, revision tips and guidance based on the examiners' reports are embedded throughout the book, alongside purposeful homework activities for each week - Cover the content in one term: a double-page spread for each lesson and a clear pathway through each unit focuses students on what they really need to know, leaving one final term for revision",

          "description": "Exam board: AQA Level: GCSE Subject: History First teaching: September 2016 First exams: Summer 2018 Make AQA GCSE History more accessible, enjoyable and manageable. Based on his own experience of teaching the specification, renowned author Dale Banham knows how to cover the content with the right pace and depth, while also equipping students with the knowledge and 'complex thinking' skills required for exam success. Using the latest research on memory and visible learning, this textbook will help to raise attainment for students of all abilities. - Engage students with accessible routes into challenging topics: the text is broken down into bullet points and boxes, while stories about interesting people start each chapter, providing a memorable 'hook' for revision - Encourage students to take responsibility for their learning: tasks are structured around five 'steps to success', teaching students how to Research, Summarise, Connect, Apply and Review the content - Make learning stick: techniques such as interleaving, retrieval practice, dual coding and spaced practice help students to remember everything and use their knowledge effectively in the exams - Build top-grade skills: the higher-order thinking skills required to construct complex arguments and reach the upper levels of the AQA mark schemes are carefully modelled, with step-by-step advice - Improve exam results: practice questions, revision tips and guidance based on the examiners' reports are embedded throughout the book, alongside purposeful homework activities for each week - Cover the content in one term: a double-page spread for each lesson and a clear pathway through each unit focuses students on what they really need to know, leaving one final term for revision The five-term plan is provided FREE for teachers in the Free schemes of work and lesson resources (available on the Dynamic Learning platform), along with editable resources that support the tasks in the textbooks and guidance on using homework effectively.",

Every page of this book is informed by meticulous research, motivated by a deep commitment to representative history and inspired by years of transformative work with students and teachers. Each period from the specification begins with a Migration Highway double-page spread that illustrates the key people, dates and turning points. Together, the Highways develop the 'big story' of migration. An overarching enquiry question for each chapter structures students' thinking and information gathering. Students then apply their learning to an end-of-chapter exam-style question. Comprehension and source questions throughout the book develop conceptual understanding and students' ability to explain, analyse, evaluate and make judgements. A rich collection of sources enables students to explore the events and developments in Notting Hill - an area of particular expertise for the authors. A dedicated chapter on Writing Better History provides step-by-step guidance for answering each question type effectively - written by highly experienced examiner Sam Slater. We are working towards endorsement of this textbook for Pearson Edexcel GCSE (9-1) History.",

It examines the reasons for immigration and the impact of immigration on Britain and its Empire.

It is written by Martin Spafford and Dan Lyndon who are both closely involved in BASA - the Black and Asian Studies Association who have led the development of this unit of the new SHP specification. The book is edited by the current Director of the Schools History Project Michael Riley and former History adviser for Devon, Jamie Byrom. Both Michael and Jamie have been driving the development of the new SHP specification, writing the content and the specimen assessment material.",

It will be invaluable as a course text for students throughout the course. It is divided into eight sections, each broken down into manageable chapters of roughly one lesson. Sections 6 and 7 of the textbook cover algorithms and programming fundamentals with a theoretical approach to provide students with experience of writing, tracing and debugging pseudocode solutions without the aid of a computer. These sections would complement practical programming experience. Each of the eight sections cover one of the major topics in this course, and each subtopic contains sample examination questions from past papers, which can be set as homework.",

          "description": "Covering the whole of the new 2016 GCSE Physics course, this book is structured around a brand new innovative assessment framework that uses regular check points and tailored intervention to help all students make progress.This book has been entered into the AQA approval process. Written by a team of expert authors for the 2016 AQA specification, this book covers the whole of the new GCSE Physics course. It combines clear and comprehensive explanations with a wealth of practice opportunities, and builds the skills that students will need to succeed. - Track students' progress in the new linear GCSE course through a brand new, innovative assessment framework. Teaching is organised into four semesters that function as checkpoints.- Each spread starts with language and ideas at a lower level and increases in complexity, engaging students of all ability levels- Key concept spreads highlight concepts that students must grasp before they can move on- Stipulated practicals spreads in each chapter build and test students' development of the appropriate skills (e.g. analysing, evaluating and applying to different contexts)- Maths skills are embedded throughout the book and tested at the appropriate level- Real-life contexts and applications are included to show the students the relevance of the concepts they are studying- Prepare students for the demands of the new specification with differentiated questions, worked examples and lots of opportunities to practice- Co-teach both Foundation and Higher tier with a single book (the Higher-only content is clearly flagged)",

          "description": "This textbook is endorsed by OCR and supports the specification for AS and A-Level Ancient History (first teaching September 2017). It covers the whole of Component 1, both the compulsory Period Study and the three optional Depth Studies:Period Study: Relations between Greek states and between Greek and non-Greek states, 492-404 BC by Steve Matthews and James RenshawDepth Study: The Politics and Society of Sparta, 478-404 BC by Charlie CottamDepth Study: The Politics and Culture of Athens c. 460-399 BC by David L. S. Hodgkinson and James RenshawDepth Study: The Rise of Macedon, 359-323 BC by Lucy NicholasHow and why did a small group of city states defy the might of the Persian Empire? Why did the same city states subsequently descend into 60 years of conflict among themselves? Were Sparta and Athens very different? How did Alexander later redefine the Greek world?These are the sort of questions that you are required to consider for A-Level Ancient History. This book investigates how the birth of democracy and the defeat of Persia allowed a flourish of political and philosophical thought that subsequently defined western civilisation. It further explores the contrasts between Spartan and Athenian culture.The ideal preparation for the final examinations, all content is presented by experts and experienced teachers in a clear and accessible narrative. Ancient literary and visual sources are described and analysed, with supporting images. Helpful student features include study questions, further reading, and boxes focusing in on key people, events and terms. Practice questions and exam guidance prepare students for assessment.A Companion Website is available at www.bloomsbury.com\/ anc-hist-as-a-level.",

It covers all three options for Component 11: World of the Hero (Homer's Iliad, Homer's Odyssey and Virgil's Aeneid). Why does the Trojan War continue to fascinate us? What makes Odysseus a hero?

The colour illustrations, from the Cyclops on a Greek pot to a photograph of protesting Yadizi women, reflect the universal impact and continuing relevance of these classical epics.The ideal preparation for the final examinations, all content is presented by an expert and experienced teacher in a clear and accessible narrative. Ancient literary sources are described and analysed. Helpful student features include study questions, quotations from contemporary scholars, further reading, and boxes focusing in on key people, events and terms.

How did drama challenge Athenians to reflect on their way of living? How did the emperor Augustus present himself as the restorer of Rome's greatness? To what extent did he provide an example to later political figures as a promoter of his regime? This book guides AS and A-Level students to a greater understanding of these issues. The Greek Theatre chapter explores the festival context in which tragedies and comedies were performed, and then analyses three plays: Oedipus the King by Sophocles, Bacchae by Euripides and Frogs by Aristophanes. The Imperial Image chapter analyses the self-presentation of Rome's most dynamic emperor, who claimed to have found Rome 'a city of bricks, but left it a city of marble'.

This full-colour Student Book covers all core and optional units for the AQA AS and A Level Geography specification for first teaching from September 2016. Students are encouraged to develop links between physical and human topics, understand systems, processes, and acquire geographical skills. Helping to bridge the gap from GCSE to A Level, it also provides support for fieldwork skills and for the geographical investigation at A Level. A 'Maths for geographers' feature helps students develop and apply their mathematical and statistical skills, and a range of assessment-style questions support students in developing their exam skills.",

          "description": "Our new A Level textbook is written in the straightforward, easy-to-grasp style for which Pat Heathcote and Rob Heathcote are well-known. Each chapter in the book corresponds to roughly one lesson, and contains questions and exercises which can be done in class, as well as questions at the end of each chapter which can be set as homework. Answers to all questions are provided in downloadable pdf format available free to teachers from the PG Online website. This book is divided into twelve sections comprising 72 chapters, which together provide complete coverage of the new AS and A Level course. Two short appendices contain A Level content that could be taught in the first year of the course as an extension to related AS topics. The specification is written in such a way that AS and A Level students can be taught together. Programming solutions within the textbook are all written in pseudocode to suit all practical languages being taught alongside the theory. To accompany this textbook, PG Online also publishes a series of six downloadable teaching units. Each topic in a unit consists of a PowerPoint presentation, teacher's notes, worksheets, homework sheets and a final assessment test with exam-style questions. Pat Heathcote and Rob Heathcote both have years of experience as teachers, authors and examiners.",

          "description": "The aim of this book is to provide detailed coverage of the topics in the new OCR AS and A Level Computer Science specifications H046 \/ H446. The book is divided into twelve sections and within each section, each chapter covers material that can comfortably be taught in one or two lessons. Material that is applicable only to the second year of the full A Level is clearly marked. Sometimes this may include an entire chapter and at other times, just a small part of a chapter. Each chapter contains exercises and questions, some new and some from past examination questions. Answers to all these are available to teachers only in a free Teacher's Pack which can be ordered from our website www.pgonline.co.uk. This book has been written to cover the topics which will be examined in the written papers at both AS and A Level. Sections 10, 11 and 12 relate principally to problem solving skills, with programming techniques covered in sufficient depth to allow students to answer questions in Component 02. Pseudocode, rather than any specific programming language, is used in the algorithms given in the text. Sample Python programs which implement many of the algorithms are included in a folder with the Teacher's Pack.",
