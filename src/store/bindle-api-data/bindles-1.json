          "description": "Our new A Level textbook is written in the straightforward, easy-to-grasp style for which Pat Heathcote and Rob Heathcote are well-known. Each chapter in the book corresponds to roughly one lesson, and contains questions and exercises which can be done in class, as well as questions at the end of each chapter which can be set as homework. Answers to all questions are provided in downloadable pdf format available free to teachers from the PG Online website. This book is divided into twelve sections comprising 72 chapters, which together provide complete coverage of the new AS and A Level course. Two short appendices contain A Level content that could be taught in the first year of the course as an extension to related AS topics. The specification is written in such a way that AS and A Level students can be taught together. Programming solutions within the textbook are all written in pseudocode to suit all practical languages being taught alongside the theory. To accompany this textbook, PG Online also publishes a series of six downloadable teaching units. Each topic in a unit consists of a PowerPoint presentation, teacher's notes, worksheets, homework sheets and a final assessment test with exam-style questions. Pat Heathcote and Rob Heathcote both have years of experience as teachers, authors and examiners.",

          "description": "The aim of this book is to provide detailed coverage of the topics in the new OCR AS and A Level Computer Science specifications H046 \/ H446. The book is divided into twelve sections and within each section, each chapter covers material that can comfortably be taught in one or two lessons. Material that is applicable only to the second year of the full A Level is clearly marked. Sometimes this may include an entire chapter and at other times, just a small part of a chapter. Each chapter contains exercises and questions, some new and some from past examination questions. Answers to all these are available to teachers only in a free Teacher's Pack which can be ordered from our website www.pgonline.co.uk. This book has been written to cover the topics which will be examined in the written papers at both AS and A Level. Sections 10, 11 and 12 relate principally to problem solving skills, with programming techniques covered in sufficient depth to allow students to answer questions in Component 02. Pseudocode, rather than any specific programming language, is used in the algorithms given in the text. Sample Python programs which implement many of the algorithms are included in a folder with the Teacher's Pack.",

          "description": "Exam Board: OCR Level & Subject: GCSE Chemistry First teaching: September 2016 Next exams: June 2023 OCR endorsed GCSE Science is changing and OCR Gateway GCSE (9-1) Chemistry from Collins has been developed to embed the skills your students need to succeed in all three assessment objectives, while providing a clear and supportive route through the new, more challenging GCSE content. Each spread starts with language and ideas at a lower level and increases in complexity, engaging students of all ability levels Key concept spreads highlight knowledge that students must grasp before they can move on Dedicated pages on analysing, interpreting and evaluating practicals, so students are fully prepared for the indirect assessment. Maths activities at the appropriate level are embedded throughout, along with Maths skills pages that focus on developing the skills needed for each topic Prepare students for the demands of the new specification with differentiated questions, worked examples and lots of opportunities to practice Co-teach both Foundation and Higher tier with a single book (the Higher-only content is clearly flagged).",
